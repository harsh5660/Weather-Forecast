# Weather Forecast 
# Course Objective:
Weather conditions gauges are made by gathering however much information as could 
reasonably be expected about the present status of the environment (especially the 
temperature, stickiness, and wind) and utilizing comprehension of barometrical cycles 
(through meteorology) to decide how the air develops from now on. Weather forecasts 
determine the expectation of the condition of the air for a given area utilizing the use of 
science and innovation. This incorporates temperature, downpour, darkness, wind speed, and 
moistness. Climate admonitions are an extraordinary sort of short-range gauge for the 
insurance of human existence. The objective of climate expectation is to give data individuals 
and associations can use to diminish climate-related misfortunes and upgrade cultural 
advantages, including assurance of life and property, general wellbeing and security, and 
backing of monetary flourishing and personal satisfaction. Climatology and Weather 
Forecasting are significant since it decides future environment assumptions. Using the scope, 
one can decide the probability of snow and hail arriving at the surface. We can likewise have 
the option to recognize the nuclear power from the sun that is available to a locale.
# Problem Statement:
Rainfall Prediction is the application of science and technology to predict the amount of rainfall 
over the region. It is important to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water 
resources, crop productivity, and pre-planning of water structure. It is important to exactly 
determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity, and pre-planning 
of water structure.
# Outcomes:
(1) Helps people prepare for how to dress (i.e. warm weather, cold weather, windy weather, 
rainy weather). 
(2) Helps businesses and people plan for power production and how much power to use (i.e.
power companies, where to set the thermostat). 
(3) Helps people prepare if they need to take extra gear to prepare for the weather (i.e. umbrella, 
raincoat, sunscreen).
(4) Helps people plan outdoor activities (i.e. to see if rain/storms/cold weather will impact 
outdoor events).
(5) Assists organizations with anticipating transportation risks that can result from the 
weather(i.e. mist, snow, ice, storms, mists as it connects with driving and flying for instance).
(6) Assists organizations and individuals with making arrangements for serious climate and 
other climate hazards(lightning, hail, cyclones, typhoons, ice storms).
(7) Assists farmers and grounds-keepers with making arrangements for the crop water system 
and insurance (water system booking, freeze security).
